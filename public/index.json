A point process gives:\nN(t): a counting function that keeps track of the cumulative number of failures a given system has had from time zero to time t. N(t) is a step function that jumps up one every time a failure occurs and stays at the new level until the next failure. M(t) = E[N(t)] : the expected number (average number) of cumulative failures by time t for these systems. The Repair Rate (the Rate Of Occurrence Of Failures, or ROCOF) is the mean rate of failures per unit time. Mathematically, it is derivative of M(t), denoted m(t). It is also called intensity function in theory of random process. Power Law NHPP and Underlying Weibull The NHPP model is has a model for minimal repair, where the repair of a failed system is just enough to get the system operational again. In Power Law NHPP, the time to first failure follows the Weibull distribution, then each succeeding failure is governed by the model as in the case of minimal repair.\nFor Power Law NHPP model, the expected number of failures in the first t hours, M(t), is: $$E\\left[ N(t) \\right] =\\lambda\\cdot t^\\beta$$ where $\\lambda,\\beta\u0026gt;0$. The probability that the number of failures, N(t), is: $$Pr\\left[ N \\left( t \\right)= n \\right]=\\frac{\\left( \\lambda \\cdot t^\\beta \\right) \\cdot e^{-\\lambda \\cdot t^\\beta}} {n!} ;n=0,1,2,‚Ä¶ $$\nThe repair rate (or ROCOF) for this model is $$ m(t)=\\lambda\\cdot \\beta \\cdot t^{\\beta‚àí1}$$ where $\\lambda\u0026gt;0,\\beta \u0026gt; 0$.\nFor a Power Law NHPP process, the time to the first fail follows a Weibull distribution with shape parameter $\\beta$ and characteristic life $\\eta=\\left( \\lambda \\right) ^ {- \\frac {1} {\\beta}}$. The accumulated Hazard function: $$H\\left(t \\right)=\\lambda\\cdot t^\\beta$$ Culmative Distribution Function $$F\\left( t \\right) = 1-e^{-\\lambda \\cdot t^\\beta}$$\nOther names for the Power Law model are: the Duane Model and the AMSAA model. AMSAA stands for the United States Army Materials System Analysis Activity, where much theoretical work describing the Power Law model was performed in the 1970‚Äôs.\nNHPP and the Underlying Weibull time-to-failure The reliability function always follows $$R\\left( t \\right)=1-F\\left( t \\right) = e^{-H\\left( t \\right)}$$ and $$ H\\left( t \\right) = -\\ln\\left[ R\\left( t \\right) \\right]=-\\ln \\left[ 1-F\\left( t \\right) \\right]$$\nAs bad as old Meaning of $\\beta$ When $\\beta=1$, it becomes a HPP model, where $m(t)=\\lambda$.\n$E \\left[ N \\left( t \\right) \\right] =\\lambda\\cdot T$, is just a straight line, and the slope is $\\beta$.\ntodo insert plots of m(t), M(t) when beta = 0.5, 1, 2, 4\nReference NHPP http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/apr/section1/apr172.htm Weibull http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/apr/section1/apr162.htm Power Law RGA http://www.weibull.com/hotwire/issue131/relbasics131.htm Reliasoft NHPP http://reliawiki.org/index.php/Crow-AMSAA_(NHPP) https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/49012/how-to-estimate-poisson-process-using-r-or-how-to-use-nhpoisson-package Repairable Systems http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/apr/section1/apr125.htm Marvin Rausand, Arnljot H√∏yland; System Reliability Theory: Models, Statistical Methods, and Applications, 2nd Edition Mohammad Modarres - Reliability Engineering and Risk Analysis: A Practical Guide, Second Edition (2nd Edition) (8/23/09) ","date":1658361600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1658388787,"objectID":"5d6b72fa9a1c127b10966694fdd57d45","permalink":"/post/repairable-systems-and-nhpp/","publishdate":"2022-07-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/repairable-systems-and-nhpp/","section":"post","summary":"Probabilistic Models for Repairable Systerms When analyzing repairable systems, areas of interest may include assessing the expected number of failures during the warranty period, maintaining a minimum mission reliability, evaluating the rate of wearout, determining when to replace or overhaul a system and minimizing life cycle costs.","tags":[],"title":"Repairable Systems and NHPP","type":"post"},{"authors":["Yunwei Hu","Tarannom Parhizkar","Ali Mosleh"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

With the growth of the size of dynamic systems and the complexity of the interactions between hardware, software, and humans, it is extremely difficult to enumerate risky scenarios by the traditional PRA methods. In this study, a new dynamic probabilistic risk assessment methodology is proposed that employs a new exploration strategy to generate risky scenarios. The proposed methodology consists of three main modules, including simulation, planner, and scheduler. In this methodology, the engineering knowledge of the system is explicitly used to guide the simulation module to achieve higher efficiency and accuracy. The engineering knowledge is reflected in the planner module which is responsible for generating plans as a high-level map to guide the simulation. The scheduler module is responsible for guiding the simulation by controlling the timing and occurrence of the random events. In this paper, modules of the proposed methodology, and their interactions are explained in detail. The developed methodology is used to perform risk assessment of a Space Shuttle ascent phase, and results show the effectiveness of the proposed platform..","tags":[],"title":"Guided simulation for dynamic probabilistic risk assessment of complex systems: Concept, method, and application","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yunwei Hu","Âê≥ÊÅ©ÈÅî"],"categories":["Demo","ÊïôÁ®ã"],"content":"Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.
