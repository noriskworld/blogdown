<p>I am trying to do everything in tidyverse, well, everthing data related. My default is to write codes in R notebooks. Then I am bothered by the slow loading of data from csv. I tried workaround like save data as RDA or even feather, so that I don’t have to deal with slowness every time.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I tried to find out more, and to my surprise, the <code>read::read_csv</code> is even slower than <code>base::read.csv</code>, let alone the <code>data.table::fread</code></p>
<p>I spent hours to figure out why, until I found the <a href="https://community.rstudio.com/t/inline-notebook-display-is-slow-when-loading-data/5231">post</a> answered by <span class="citation">@jimhester</span>. It is clear in hindsight that interaction between the progress bar and the notebook kills the efficiency. Also the progress bar will be part of the html output chunk, which is not needed most cases.</p>
<p>The default should be disabling progress bar in Notebook environment, and Jim logged this as an issue in <a href="https://github.com/tidyverse/readr/issues/793">GitHub</a>, and hopefully we will see it fixed soon.</p>
